We created a function called createExtent. This function will create an extent based file with the name as passed into the function.
This extent based file then had the stat function called on it that way one can see some information about the file and that it is
comprised of extents and the addresses and length are provided in the print statements. We did a simple example with writing to 1
block than a larger example writing to 12 blocks. In the sysfile.c file you would find the createExtent function and how we write
to the extent based block.
